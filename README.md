# 📝 Terminal Text Editor (C, Linux)

A terminal-based text editor written in **C** for Linux environments.  
This project was inspired by classic editors like `nano` and `vim`, but aims to provide a simple, minimal editing experience while learning about terminal handling, raw input, and file I/O in C. 
The text editor uses termios to create a user interface.
